## Brainfock â€” Developer Readme
Copyright (C) 2015-present Sergii Gamaiunov <[@SergiiGama](https://twitter.com/SergiiGama)>


## Techniques
- Universal JavaScript dev stack for browser, server, mobile.
- Functional works: App state snapshots, time travel, hot reload everything.
- [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) with server side rendering on [expressjs](http://expressjs.com/) backend.
- [Redux](http://rackt.github.io/redux/) [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/) with atomic [immutable.js](http://facebook.github.io/immutable-js).
- ECMAScript 2015+ with [babeljs.io](https://babeljs.io/). [JSX](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) and [Flowtype](http://flowtype.org/) syntax supported. Sourcemaps enabled by default.
- Well tuned [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) dev stack.
- [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/) as the test runner, [mocha](http://mochajs.org/) as test framework, and [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) as BDD / TDD assertion library.
- [Shallow rendering](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/test-utils.html#shallow-rendering) for testing React components without DOM.
- [eslint](http://eslint.org/) ([Sublime Text 3 integration](https://github.com/steida/este/wiki/Recommended-Sublime-Text-3-settings#how-to-setup-the-eslint-for-st3))
- Localization via [formatjs.io](http://formatjs.io/).
- [react-router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router).
- Simple yet powerfull sync/async validation based on [chriso/validator.js](https://github.com/chriso/validator.js)
- LESS, SASS, Stylus, or plain CSS with [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer).
- Long Term Caching through file hashes.


## Prerequisites

Install [node.js](http://nodejs.org) (v4 is required).

If you are using different node versions on your machine, use `nvm` to manage them.

You may also need to upgrade `npm` to 3.x
```shell
npm install -g npm@3.x
```

## Installing

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Brainfock/Brainfock.git brainfock
cd brainfock
npm install
```

### Production setup

Brainfock uses Loopback and is ready for environment-specific configurations out-of-the-box. To complete Brainfock app
setup for production, you need to set `NODE_ENV=production` and (optionally) set any of the following properties:

* DB_HOST - database host address
* DB_PORT - database port
* DB_USER - database user
* DB_PASSWORD - database password

## Start Development

- run `npm run web-start-dev`
- point your browser to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- build something beautiful

## Dev Tasks

- `npm run web-start-dev` run app in development mode
- `npm run web-build` build web package
- `npm test` test native, web & common

## Prod Tasks

- `npm run start` just run app, remember to set NODE_ENV=production and others environment variables.

## Documentation

Choosing dev stack is a diligent process, but look no more! Brainfock uses great [Este.js](https://github.com/este/este) dev stack
made by Daniel Steigerwald, twitter.com/steida, @grabbou and the community.

> The most complete React/Flux dev stack and starter kit for universal functional web apps. Forget about [evil frameworks](http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/library-frameworks/), learn laser focused libraries and patterns instead.

Code is documentation itself as it illustrates various patterns, but for start you should read something about [React.js](http://facebook.github.io/react/). Then you should learn [what is the Flux
application architecture](https://medium.com/brigade-engineering/what-is-the-flux-application-architecture-b57ebca85b9e). Now refresh you JavaScript knowledge about "new" JavaScript - [learn ES6](https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es6/). This stack uses [immutable.js](http://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) and class-less design for a [good reason](https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js/#the-case-for-immutability). Check this nice short [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yHFTN-_mOo), wouldn't be possible with classic OOP classes everywhere approach. Functional programming is a next (current) big thing, read [why](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/the-dao-of-immutability-9f91a70c88cd).
[Loopback.io](http://loopback.io/) is used on the [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/api/) based server. Application is [universal](https://medium.com/@mjackson/universal-javascript-4761051b7ae9), so we can share code between browser, server, mobile, whatever easily. Congrats, you're Brainfock expert level 1 now :-)

## Windows

Use this if you are using JEST or another library, which has to be compiled.

- Install Python - Install version 2.7 of Python and add it to your path or/and create a PYTHONPATH environment variable.
- Install Visual Studio (Express Edition is fine) - We will need this for some of modules that are compiled when we are installing Brainfock. [Download VS Express](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-express-vs.aspx), get one of the versions that has C++ - Express 2013 for Windows Desktop for example.
- Set Visual Studio Version Flags - We need to tell node-gyp (something that is used for compiling addons) what version of Visual Studio we want to compile with. You can do this either through an environment variable GYP_MSVS_VERSION. If you are using Express, you have to say GYP_MSVS_VERSION=2013e.

## Tips and Tricks

- To check app state, press `ctrl+shift+s`, then open console.
- With global app state, we don't need IoC container so badly - [SOLID: the next step is Functional](http://blog.ploeh.dk/2014/03/10/solid-the-next-step-is-functional). Still DI is relevant for some cases and then use [Pure DI](http://blog.ploeh.dk/2014/06/10/pure-di/).
- Learn immutable.js, for example [Seq](https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js#lazy-seq). Handy even for native arrays and objects. For example, get object values: `Seq(RoomType).toSet().toJS()`
- Even though we can use `import {canUseDOM} from 'react/lib/ExecutionEnvironment'` to detect browser/server, don't do it since it's runtime value. Use webpack DefinePlugin to set `process.env.IS_BROWSER` rather, because compilation removes dead code.
- How to use Closure Tools, [gist](https://gist.github.com/steida/afbc595a1e2f27e925d9)
- Recommended editors are [sublimetext](http://www.sublimetext.com/) and [atom.io](https://atom.io) ([tips](https://github.com/steida/atom-io-settings)).

## FAQ

#### Why I am seeing warnings and errors when running `npm install`?

You can completely ignore them since they are coming from optional React Native dependencies as noted
[here](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/2655#issuecomment-139826260). They will be gone with React Native 0.12
being released.

#### Why do I get EACCES error during `npm install`?
 This indicates that you do not have permission to write to the directories that npm uses to store packages and commands. One possible solution is to change the permission to npm's default directory.
 1. Find the path to npm's directory:  `npm config get prefix`  For many systems, this will be `/usr/local`
 2. Change the owner of npm's directory's to the effective name of the current user
 ```
 sudo chown -R `whoami` <directory>
 ```

#### Why does the CSS flicker when starting the app/refreshing it?
In dev mode, webpack loads all the style inline, which makes them hot reloadable. This behaviour disappears in production mode (`NODE_ENV=production npm web-start`).

#### Do you have any live example?
You bet! There is an official demo, check it out at <http://brainfock.org>.

#### Why Brainfock is pure and why we have to pass data through props?
Pure means no side effects. Programming without side effects rocks. It allows us to hot reload everything and testing is much easier as well. When component renders only data passed through props, [shouldComponentUpdate](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/component-specs.html#updating-shouldcomponentupdate) can be implemented [only once](https://github.com/este/este/blob/d08556dd1e4d57b4c0e605e3395ce6af9963910e/src/client/components/component.react.js#L14) per whole app. One can say it's verbose, but it isn't. It's explicit. And remember, we have to pass only data going to be rendered. Actions have access to app state.

## Notes

- Brainfock dev stack works on OSX, Linux, and Windows.
- As a rule of thumb, Brainfock supports all evergreen browsers plus last two pieces of IE.
- Support Brainfock development via Bitcoin - 16oPNMcwhxEz3HMn6wkpa4HfnQUsTY6FKr
